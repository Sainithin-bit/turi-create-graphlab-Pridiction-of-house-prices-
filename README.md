Created a most  accurate linear fit model 


Put all the files in one folder and name it, using Sframe in graphlab read data at once.


1.Described input and output of a regression model
2.Calculated goodness of fit 
3.Estimated model parameters by minmizing RSS
4.Exploit the estimated model to form pridictions 
5.Performed a trning and test split
6. Analyze performance of various regression models in terms of test error 
7.Use test error to avoid overÔ¨Åtting when selecting amongst candidate models 
8.Describe a regression model using multiple features 
9.Describe other applications where regression is useful
